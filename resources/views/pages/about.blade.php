		<p>Hello there! My name is Ronan Konishi. I enjoy working with technology, exercising, and playing music. Read on to learn more about me!</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>I am a second year undergrad studying Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. At the University of California San Diego, I work under a professor as a Software Developer at the Qualcomm Institute - UCSD Division of Calit2. I am also a member of IEEE at UCSD and have participated in the 2018 Winter Quarterly project.</p>
		<br>


		<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
		<p>In addition to my university studies, I work on numerous side projects. Currently, I am developing a Smart Device that allows wireless control of devices in a room (fans, door lock, music station), a mobile smartphone game, and this blog site.</p>
		<br>


		<h3>Other Passions</h3>
		<p>Aside from developer life, I enjoy rock climbing, surfing, and playing basketball. I go indoor rock climbing several times a week, and occasionally go on outdoor climbing excursions. I plan to incorporate climbing into my weekly schedule when I return to college. UCSD is also the perfect place to surf with the amazing waves and weather!</p>
